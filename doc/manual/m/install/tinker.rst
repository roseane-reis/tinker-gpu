Download the Canonical Tinker
=============================

Using an incorrect Tinker version, may result in the Tinker-GPU executables failing with a segfault.
Downloading of the required Tinker version is automated in the CMake script, or Tinker can be obtained
directly from the Tinker GitHub repository. Use one of the following procedures to get the correct Tinker.

   If this source code was cloned by Git, you can
   checkout Tinker from the *tinker* Git submodule:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # checkout Tinker
      cd tinker-gpu
      git submodule update --init

   Alternatively, remove the directory *tinker-gpu/tinker* and clone
   `Tinker from GitHub <https://github.com/tinkertools/tinker>`_
   to replace the deleted directory, then checkout the
   required version, currently Tinker commit 336a6c0d.

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd tinker-gpu
      rm -rf tinker
      git clone https://github.com/tinkertools/tinker
      cd tinker
      git checkout <required version commit tag>
